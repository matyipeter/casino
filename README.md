# casino
online casion webapp project

# 1.
- registration with email verification
- login,logout (built-in classes)
- initial navbar
- login/reg ... buttons need to be visible on smaller devices (probable solution: dropdown menu) still in progress

# 2.
- W3CSS navbar and menu
- Frontend upgrade
- Added a few games (the backend will be done later)
- user model almost finished (account template is still needed)
- index.html grid system is still not working as expected (cannot put a gap between the columns without pushing the items to the next row) => fixes will be needed

# 3.
- Transaction History and Winning History models added (winning history will be used later)
- account.html set up (requires some more styling)
- deposit, withdraw views are working pretty well, their templates need styling
- pop up sidebar on index page with w3css
- password change with built in auth view (template requires styling)
- transactionhistory listing on account page
- account page should be better looking on desktop
